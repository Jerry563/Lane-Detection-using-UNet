# Lane-Detection-using-UNet

##Description
Lane detection is a very important field in autonomous driving. Traditional lane detection aprroach of Hough Transform can only detects straight lines, and the performance is limited by light condition, shadow, other objects on the ground, etc. So I use the deep learning approach to accomplish such task.
